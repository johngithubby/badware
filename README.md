## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run dev:clean`       | Kills any stray Astro dev processes & starts on a stable high port (default 4913) |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

### About `dev:clean`

Because this site sets a `base` (`/badware`) for GitHub Pages, the dev server sometimes left zombie processes that still held default ports (4321/4322). The `dev:clean` script force‑kills any lingering `astro dev` processes and then starts a fresh server on a low‑collision port (`4913` by default). You can override the port:

```sh
DEV_PORT=5005 npm run dev:clean
```

If you prefer the classic default port again after a reboot (when nothing is bound):

```sh
DEV_PORT=4321 npm run dev:clean
```

Use this script whenever you see repeated "Port XXXX is in use" messages or the dev server silently hops ports.
